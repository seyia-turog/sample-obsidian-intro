## Overview

The Clients Module serves as the central hub for managing registered customer for tenants (Banks and Fintechs) within the ADIBA ecosystem. This module is responsible for the complete lifecycle management of client entities, enabling the platform to effectively serve both institutional and individual users with tailored experiences and services.

The module distinguishes between two primary client categories to ensure appropriate service delivery and compliance requirements:

- **Corporate Clients**: Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) and Enterprise-level organizations that require advanced banking services, bulk transaction capabilities, and dedicated relationship management
- **Individual Clients**: Retail customers who access personal banking services, individual investment products, and consumer-focused financial solutions

### Core Business Functions

The Clients Module provides essential business operations that support the entire ADIBA platform:

- **Client Onboarding**: Streamlined registration process for new stakeholders with automated verification and compliance checks
- **Client Profile Management**: Comprehensive updating of client information, preferences, and service configurations to maintain accurate relationship data
- **Client Lifecycle Management**: Secure removal and archival of client records when relationships are terminated or accounts are closed
- **Client Data Retrieval**: Efficient lookup and retrieval of individual client profiles for service delivery and relationship management
- **Client Portfolio Management**: Bulk operations and reporting capabilities for managing large client bases across different segments
